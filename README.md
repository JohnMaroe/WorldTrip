# Ignite - #6 challenge

### Rocketseat's bootcamp sixth challenge. <br />
This challenge introduces Declarative Interfaces using Chakra UI with NextJS. We are challenged to create a trip advisor app and create a fake JSON server for storing
information about the application.  <br />
This different type of design system is interesting and changes most of the structure of an application. Your stylization will be together with your structure
which makes you plan differently about what you're doing.

<br />

## :satellite: How to run project
Clone the project and access the folder

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/JohnMaroe/desafio06-ignite-worldtrip.git && cd desafio06-ignite-worldtrip
```

Follow the steps below
```bash
# Install the dependencies
$ yarn

# Start the project
$ yarn dev
# The server will start at port:3000 - go to http://localhost:3000

# Run the JSON server so the API can work
$ yarn server
```
